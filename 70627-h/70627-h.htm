<div class="pageborder">
<p>One evening, after Uncle Wiggily, the nice bunny rabbit gentleman,
had been out all day, looking in the woods for adventures, he
came home to his hollow stump bungalow. He and Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy sat down to read. It was a warm night and the window
was open. All of a sudden there was a loud buzzing sound in the
room. “What’s that?” asked Uncle Wiggily, looking over his glasses.
“Oh, it’s a big June Bug!” cried Nurse Jane. “The largest I have
even seen! Oh, if it gets tangled in my hair I’ll never get it out!”</p>
</div>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>“Nonsense, Nurse Jane! A June Bug cannot harm you,” said
Uncle Wiggily. But the muskrat lady grew very excited. She stood
up on a chair and flapped her paper at the Bug. Uncle Wiggily
took his tall silk hat in one paw and the tea strainer in the other and
said he would catch the buzzing creature and let him sleep in the
pansy bed. “There’s no harm in him,” said the bunny, “and who
knows when you may want a June Bug to do you a favor?” After
a while Uncle Wiggily caught the insect and gently put him to bed.</p>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>The next day, after Uncle Wiggily had been so kind to the June
Bug, putting him in the pansy bed, the rabbit gentleman was out
walking in the woods with Nannie and Billie Wagtail, the two goat
children. “Tell us more about the funny June Bug, Uncle Wiggily,”
bleated Billie. “He was funny, but Nurse Jane was afraid of him,”
said Uncle Wiggily, laughing. “I caught him in the tea strainer and
gave him some sugar. He said he would do me a favor some day, if
he could. But wait a minute. That looks like danger ahead!”</p>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>Uncle Wiggily, Nannie and Billie Wagtail came to a stop just
at the edge where some sticks were criss-crossed on the woodland
path. The bunny thought it was a trap and it was. All of a sudden
Uncle Wiggily, Billie and Nannie fell into a deep pit which the bad
Bazumpus had dug, hoping to catch the bunny. “Oh, dear!” bleated
the little goat girl. “If ever we wanted help it is now! Where is that
June Bug, Uncle Wiggily?” Billie tried to scramble out by digging
his horns in the side of the pit, but could not. Oh, what trouble!</p>
</div>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>After Uncle Wiggily, Billie and Nannie had tried to get out of
the pit, only to find themselves slipping back all the while, they suddenly
heard a buzzing sound up above them, and there was the June
Bug. “I want to thank you again, Uncle Wiggily, for being so kind
to me last night,” buzzed the Bug. “I saw you fall into this pit, as I
was flying away from your bungalow a little while ago. Now I am
going to help you out.” Billie Wagtail shook his horns. “I don’t
see how even a big June Bug can help us,” he said. “Oh, dear!”</p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>After the June Bug had looked down in the pit the Bazumpus
had dug, the insect flew away, saying: “I’ll soon be back with a lot
of my sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles and aunts, and we’ll get you
out of the pit, Uncle Wiggily.” The bunny said that would be very
kind. So the June Bug fluttered his wings and whistled on his hind
legs and hundreds of other bugs buzzed up to see what was the
matter. “We must make a ladder of grass stems so Uncle Wiggily
can get out of the pit,” said the big June Bug.</p>
</div>
<br>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>Buzzing their wings, and weaving with their legs, the kind June
Bugs soon made a long, strong grass ladder. “Now,” said the big
June Bug, “we will carry it to the pit, lower it down, fasten the upper
end to a tree, and Uncle Wiggily, Nannie and Billie can climb out.”
The bad old Bazumpus, and his club, by which he hoped to knock
some souse off Uncle Wiggily’s ears, saw the bugs marching along
with the grass ladder. “I wonder what they are going to do?”
thought the bad chap. “I must watch and see.”</p>

</figure>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>Reaching the pit, in which were Uncle Wiggily and the goat
children, the June Bugs fastened the ladder so it would not slip, and
tossed the other end down in the hole. Then Nannie and Billie
climbed up, and then it was Uncle Wiggily’s turn. “See, Billie, I told
you a June Bug could help us,” said the bunny gentleman, as he got
to the top of the pit. “But who dug that hole?” asked Mr. Longears.
“It was the Bazumpus!” buzzed the largest June Bug. “Yes, and
there he is now!” cried Nannie, as she saw the bad creature. “Look!”</p>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>As soon as the rabbit was safely out of the pit, the biggest June
Bug cried: “Now, my friends, since we have saved Uncle Wiggily
and paid him back for the favor he did me, chase the Bazumpus!”
And all the Bugs chased the bad chap, tickling him with long spears
of grass so that he ran away as fast as he could go. Nannie and Billie
danced for joy because their bunny uncle was saved, and Mr. Longears
shook paws with the big June Bug and invited him to come to
dinner that day. So everybody was happy but the Bazumpus.</p>

<p>“Nurse Jane ought to like the bungalow much better after I paint
it sky blue pink,” said Uncle Wiggily as he stood on a ladder putting
some dabs of color on his hollow stump house. “I hope nothing happens
when I am up here. If I should fall in the pots of paints I’d look
like some scrambled Easter eggs.” Uncle Wiggily had used up nearly
all the color in one pot when he saw Billie Wagtail, the goat, and
Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow coming along. “I’ll ask one of them
to hand me another pot of paint,” said the bunny.</p>

<p>“Hello, boys!” called Uncle Wiggily, as Billie, Jackie and Peetie
came near. “Will one of you please hand me up another pot of red
paint? My can is almost empty.” Billie the goat said he’d bring
up some red paint, but, instead, just for a joke, he took up some
green paint to Uncle Wiggily. “Won’t he be surprised when he
starts daubing green paint over where he put the red,” said Jackie
to Peetie. “It will be a good joke,” agreed Peetie. “But I hope he
doesn’t get mad at us.”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily was so busy talking to Billie, Jackie and Peetie
that the bunny rabbit never noticed the color of the paint the goat
boy handed up to him. And, before he knew it, Mr. Longears had
daubed some green color on where it ought to have been red. “Oh
my! Nurse Jane will not like this a bit!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “I
did it for a joke!” laughed Billie. “Wait a minute and I’ll hand you
up the right color.” Nearer and nearer came the skillery-scallery
alligator.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, as Billie was getting ready to take up the right
pot of red paint, up rushed the funny old skillery scallery alligator,
with the double jointed tail. “Ah ha, Mr. Longears! At last I
have you!” cried the ’gator. “Come down off that ladder until
I nibble a bit of your souse!” Uncle Wiggily was so surprised that
he spilled some paint on Jackie, Peetie and Billie. But still the
bunny rabbit gentleman would not come down to have his souse
nibbled.</p>

<p>“Well, if you won’t come down nice and pretty when I tell
you to, so I may have some of your souse, I’ll make you tumble!”
said the bad ’gator to Uncle Wiggily. Then the unpleasant chap
yanked the ladder out from the side of the hollow stump bungalow
and the bunny rabbit gentleman began to fall. “Oh, I am almost
sure I am going to have an adventure this time!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Something is going to happen!” And Billie, Jackie and Peetie
thought the same thing.</p>

<p>The skillery scallery alligator pulled the ladder so hard, hoping
to make Uncle Wiggily fall, that the ladder toppled into a tree near
by. Uncle Wiggily gave a jump and landed on one of the branches.
“Are you coming down out of that and let me nibble your souse?”
asked the snippy-snappy ’gator. Uncle Wiggily said he was not.
“Then with my rough nutmeg grater tail I’ll saw down the tree and
get you anyhow,” snarled the bad chap. “I’ll saw the tree down
and get your souse!”</p>

“Very well then, now I’ll begin to saw!” gargled the bad chap. So
with his tail, which was just like a saw, he began to cut down the
tree. “Oh, we must save Uncle Wiggily!” whispered Billie the
goat. “Yes, but how can we?” asked Jackie. “I know,” barked
Peetie. “We’ll paint the alligator’s tail red, and he’ll think he has
the nose-bleed!”</p>

<p>All of a sudden, when the alligator had the tree almost sawed
through, and it was beginning to fall with Uncle Wiggily in it, the
three animal boys rushed up with their pots of paint. “Splatter him
good!” barked Jackie, and he and Peetie and Billie splashed different
kinds of paint on the bad ’gator. “Oh my goodness me!” grunted
the skillery scallery chap. “This will spoil my complexion! This
is no place for me! I’ll get Uncle Wiggily’s souse some other time,
I guess.”</p>

<p>Jackie, Peetie and Billie splashed so much paint on the ’gator,
even putting some in his eyes, that the bad chap was glad enough
to run away. He looked like a broken piece of the rainbow. Uncle
Wiggily easily got down out of the fallen tree, and he felt so happy,
at saving his souse, that he danced a jig around the paint pots with
the doggies and the goat. “Well I never!” exclaimed Nurse Jane.
“This is a funny way to paint a red bungalow green, Uncle Wiggily!”
But the bunny gentlemen only laughed.</p>

<p>One day Uncle Wiggily Longears stopped at the home of Mrs.
Wibblewobble, the duck lady. Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy had asked
the bunny gentleman to call and return an egg she had borrowed.
Uncle Wiggily found Mrs. Littletail, the rabbit, Mrs. Bushytail, the
squirrel, Mrs. Bow Wow, the dog lady, and Mrs. Kat, the pussy lady,
at Mrs. Wibblewobble’s house. “Is this a party?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“Oh, no,” said Mrs. Wibblewobble, “but I could make it one if
I had a few nice May blossoms.” Uncle Wiggily said he’d get some.</p>

<div class="pageborder">
<p>Uncle Wiggily went into the early, green spring woods. He
began looking at the ground. Pretty soon he met Jimmie Wibblewobble,
the duck, and Curly and Floppy Twistytail, the two piggie
boys. “What are you looking for, Uncle Wiggily?” asked Floppy.
“For some nice May flowers to make pretty bouquets so Mrs. Wibblewobble
can have them for her little reception party,” answered the
bunny. “But, boys, I am sorry to say I haven’t yet found a single
blossom.” The animal boys felt sad for Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“Hey, fellows, I know how we can have some fun!” quacked
Jimmie the duck. “How?” asked Curly, while Floppy balanced a
stick and a leaf on the end of his nose, like a juggler in the circus.
“Uncle Wiggily will never find any flowers in the woods. It is too
early,” said Jimmie. “But near my house are a lot of ladies hats,
with some dandy flowers on. We could take some off, plant ’em in
the woods where Uncle Wiggily would find them and then he’d be
happy.” The two piggie boys said that would be fun. Now let’s see.</p>

<p>Jimmie Wibblewobble, the duck boy, meaning no harm, of
course, led Curly and Floppy back to his house. Mrs. Wibblewobble
and her animal lady friends were so busy talking that they did not
notice what the boys did. The boys began pulling the pretty blossoms
off the hats. “We’ll stick them in the ground among the trees, and
lead Uncle Wiggily to them,” quacked Jimmie. “He’ll think they’re
real blossoms and he’ll pick a big bouquet.” Floppy laughed and
Curly said: “We ought to put perfume on ’em and make ’em smell.”</p>

<p>After Jimmie, Curly and Floppy had pulled from the ladies’ hats
as many of the make-believe flowers as they wanted, the animal boys
hurried off to the woods again. “I’ll get my mother’s perfume atomizer
bottle and we’ll make the flowers smell as sweet as real ones,”
grunted Floppy. And in the picture you see how the animal chaps
planted the artificial flowers in the green moss of the woods. Floppy
sprayed some lovely perfume over them, so that they smelled just
as real as anything. Meanwhile Uncle Wiggily was out of luck.</p>

you can pick for the reception party at my house!” “It is very kind
of you boys,” said the rabbit gentleman. “I have been looking all
over for May flowers, but could not find any.” And when Jimmy,
Curly and Floppy pointed to the blossoms the bunny felt very jolly.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily began picking a bouquet of what he thought were
real flowers for Mrs. Wibblewobble. He filled one paw with a big
bunch of the artificial blossoms. “How nice and sweet they smell!”
said the bunny, holding a rose to his nose. “We are glad you like
them,” quacked Jimmie, politely. “Don’t let Uncle Wiggily see that
perfume bottle, Floppy!” grunted Curly in a whisper. Floppy hid the
atomizer behind his back and Uncle Wiggily kept on picking flowers.

said Uncle Wiggily with a polite bow. “Oh, how lovely and kind of

where to get the May flowers, Uncle Wiggily?” asked the rabbit lady.
“Yes,” answered Mr. Longears. “Oh, the little rascals!” quacked

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
